ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

I'm a **DBRE (Database Reliability Engineer)** with a passion for **coding**. I spend my days optimizing database systems and ensuring their reliability, but I also love diving into Python code to create tools, scripts and automations that make life easier.

Youâ€™ll find a lot of **Python projects** in my repos, along with some repositories dedicated to **documentation and troubleshooting**, where I share my experience with various technical challenges and solutions.

Explore my work, and if anything resonates, feel free to reach out!
